# CFF Path Finder Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to implement several pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra and Floyd, on the CFF (Swiss Federal Railways) network. The network is contained in a XML file provided as a resource to the project, but is not the official data from CFF.

## How to use it
You can put the jar and the data folder present on the [release page](https://github.com/maximelovino/CFF_PathFinder/releases) in the same folder and then run using

```java -jar CFF_PathFinder.jar```
